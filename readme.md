‘Ambient Garden Thriller’ (AGT) is an interactive ambient web experience powered by Processing.js and HTML5. This web app allows users to discover and document the unique ephemeral 2D creatures that inhabit their browser. The appearance, desires, and locomotion of these lifeforms as well as their habitats within the canvas are algorithmically generated with a dash of patterned randomness (perlin noise). Features include an implementation of emergent flocking, scatter/swarm responsive behaviors, and perlin flow fields. Visitors can take snapshots of their discoveries and explore the gallery to view the glimpses of creatures that they and others have observed.
