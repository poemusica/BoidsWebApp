							<p><a href="/">Ambient Garden Thriller</a> is an interactive ambient web experience powered by Processing.js and HTML5. Discover and document unique ephemeral 2D creatures that inhabit your browser. The appearance, desires, and locomotion of these lifeforms as well as their habitats are algorithmically generated with a dash of patterned randomness. Features include emergent flocking, scatter/swarm behaviors, and perlin flow fields. Take a snapshot of your discovery and explore the gallery to view glimpses of creatures that you and others have observed.</p> 
							<p>Technology stack: Flask, Jinja2, AWS, Postgres, SQLAlchemy, Processing.js, JQuery, AJAX, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3.</p>
							<p>Languages: Python, Javascript, Processing (Java-like).</p>
